This is a tic tac toe game(human vs human) with GUI, which is also my very first project.

The layout of the game contains three parts:

    Part 1: radioPanel contains 4 radio buttons(player1,player2,Xmarker,Omarker).

    Part 2: gameBoard,grid layout(3*3)

    Part 3: controlPanel contains 2 buttons(start,restart)
